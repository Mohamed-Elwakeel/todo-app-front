# Todo App - Frontend

- A simple and intuitive Todo App frontend built with React.js. This application provides three main pages for managing todos: Sign In, Sign Up, and Home.
- I am still working on the backend of this project and the setting up the database, so you todo data and login data will not be saved for NOW.
